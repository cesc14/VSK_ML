# VSK_ML

Extension of the Variably Scaled Kernels (VSKs) setting to machine learning applications with Support Vector Machines (SVMs).

An example of this stacking technique is provided in **script_svm_knn.py**, where the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is considered for the variably scaled setting.
